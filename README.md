# Rust Pong Game
A simple implementation of the classic Pong game built in Rust. This project showcases basic graphics rendering, user input handling, and game physics using the `piston` game engine.

# Rust Pong Game.
It simulates a table tennis match where two players control their paddles while attempting to hit the ball past their opponent.

### Tools and Libraries
*	Piston: A modular game engine in Rust. It provides functionalities such as handling events (keyboard, mouse, etc.), rendering graphics, and managing game windows.
*	OpenGL: A widely-used graphics library that helps render 2D and 3D graphics. The opengl_graphics crate is used to interface with OpenGL for rendering.
*	Graphics: A simple library that provides useful primitives (like rectangles) for rendering graphics in a 2D space.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay with keyboard controls
- Real-time paddle and ball movement
- Basic collision detection and physics
- Score tracking (future implementation planned)

</br>

## Design Overview
The game window contains:
- **Left Paddle:** controlled via `W` (up) and `S` (down)
- **Right Paddle:** controlled via `Up Arrow` and `Down Arrow`
- **Ball:** bounces off paddles and window edges
- **Score:** (to be implemented)

### Gameplay loop:
1. Handle user input to move paddles
2. Update ball position based on velocity
3. Detect collisions with paddles and window bounds
4. Render the current game state
